<p class="bio">I was born in San Jose, California and moved to Michigan when I was four. Seventeen years later, I am at the
University of Kansas Studying Computer Science. I live in an old house with three other girls.
 One is super religious, the second one hopes to be a social worker, and the third has
 stolen my fruit six times now. It's kind of fun I guess. I really like cooking so it's cool to have
a kitchen that I can do that in. </p>
